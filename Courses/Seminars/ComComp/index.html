<h3>Course Description</h3>
The need for communication arises whenever two or more computers,
systems or humans need to jointly perform a task that
they cannot perform alone.  In this course we will study
the question of how much communication is necessary to solve
a given computational problem.   

Such questions are of fundamental interest
in their own right, and are also increasingly important
to the understanding of computational requirements for 
algorithms for massive data sets,
most notably in the streaming model.

We will cover selected topics from the text "Communication
Complexity" by E. Kushilevitz and N. Nisan.
At the end of the semester, if time and interest permits,
we will cover papers on recent applications of communication complexity
to lower bounds for the streaming model.
Students are expected to present a lecture on a section of the book.

<hr>
<h3> Grading </h3>
Will be based on the student presentation 
(including the practice talk) and class participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;10 point will 
be taken off for each unjustified absence,&nbsp; and 5 for an outrages late.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<h3> Prerequisites</h3>
Some knowledge of algorithms and basics of probability.
<h3> Time and location </h3>
    The seminar will take place on Thursdays, 10:00-12:00, in Kaplun 324
<h3> Text </h3>
